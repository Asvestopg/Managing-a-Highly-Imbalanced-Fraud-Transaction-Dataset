Fraud Detection Tutorial
Welcome to the Fraud Detection Tutorial repository! In this tutorial, we explore effective methods for handling highly imbalanced datasets using the imbalanced-learn (imblearn) library. The dataset used for this tutorial is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset available on Kaggle.

What is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset?
The Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset is a real-world dataset containing credit card transactions. It's commonly used in machine learning and data science for fraud detection tasks. The dataset comprises a large number of credit card transactions, with features derived from transaction details. Notably, it exhibits a severe class imbalance, with a vast majority of transactions being non-fraudulent and a small minority being fraudulent. This imbalance makes it a challenging dataset to work with and is a common issue in real-world applications of machine learning, such as fraud detection.

The code in this repository serves as part of a comprehensive tutorial featured on my blog at codelander.com. On my blog, you can find a treasure trove of informative tutorials covering various aspects of machine learning and software engineering. This specific tutorial focuses on strategies for addressing highly imbalanced datasets.

Techniques Explored
In this tutorial, we delve into the intricacies of managing imbalanced datasets, with a particular focus on the imbalanced-learn (imblearn) library. Two key techniques explored are Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and Near-Miss undersampling techniques. These methods provide valuable insights and practical approaches to deal with the challenges presented by imbalanced datasets.

Explore the code, experiment with the techniques, and discover how to handle class imbalance effectively in your machine learning projects.
